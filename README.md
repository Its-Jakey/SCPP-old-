# SCPP

### This programming language is **VERY** unstable! If you find a bug, please report it in the 'issues' tab.
#### You can find the current list of known bugs [here](Known%20bugs.txt), documentation on the syntax [here](Syntax.md), and documentation on the builtin libraries [here](Libraries.md)

This programming language is filled with bugs and is design to *NOT* be used practically
Make sure you read the [known bugs](Known%20bugs.txt) *BEFORE* you report a new one


P.S. The /tests folder is just filled with random stuff i was playing around with, the only one that works is [this](tests/demo.cmm)
