# SCPP

### This programming language is **VERY** unstable! If you find a bug, please report it in the 'issues' tab.
#### You can find the current list of known bugs [here](Known%20bugs.txt), documentation on the syntax [here](Syntax.md), and documentation on the builtin libraries [here](Libraries.md)

This programming language is filled with bugs and is design to *NOT* be used practically
Make sure you read the [known bugs](Known%20bugs.txt) *BEFORE* you report a new one

## Usage
Java must be installed in order to run the compiler
#### compiling
To compile your file run

    java -jar [INPUT_FILE] [OUTPUT_FILE.txt]
#### running
To run your file, goto [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/697633215/editor/) Scratch project, then right-click the "program" list and hit the "import" button then select your file. You can then click the flag to run the program. 

P.S. The /tests folder is just filled with random stuff I was playing around with, the only one that works is [this](tests/demo.cmm)
