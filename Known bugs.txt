Known bugs (Before ':' is the description, after is how to produce it)

Strings {
    Strings cannot start with ':':                                      var str = ":hi";
    Strings cannot contain '"':                                         var str = "sup \"world\"";
    Putting newlines (\n) in strings may break everything:              var str = "line1\nline2";
    Layered 'strings::join(a, b)' sometimes doesn't work:               var str = strings::join("hello", strings::join(" ", "world"));
}

Other {
    '#define' only works with integers: #define INTEGER_CONSTANT "Sup"
}
